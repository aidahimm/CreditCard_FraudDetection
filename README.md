# CreditCard_FraudDetection
A Machine Learning Model integrated with a Flask application for the course Data Mining and Machine Learning at University of Pisa.

To run this application we recommend creating and activating a Python virtual environment using the following commands:

```
python3 -m venv path/to/env
source path/to/env/bin/activate
```
Install the necessary packages using the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And finally run the flask server with:
```
flask run
```
